{2 That 
}{ That is a very common word in both writing and speaking. We use it as a determiner, a demonstrative pronoun and a relative pronoun. We also use it as a conjunction to introduce that -clauses. 
}
===
{2 That : determiner and pronoun 
}{ We use that most commonly to point to a thing or person. We use it with singular nouns. The thing or person is often distant from the speaker and sometimes closer to the listener, or not visible to either the speaker or listener: 
 Can you pass me that green bowl over there? (determiner) 
\[pointing to one of a selection of different paint colours\]
 I quite like that one. 
 That ’s Harold in the white shirt, isn’t it? (pronoun) 
 We also use that to refer back to a whole clause: 
 We’re having a few friends round for dinner. Would you like to come? 
 That sounds lovely . 
 Why don’t you come at around 8? That ’ll give me time to get ready. 
 Can you tell Kat to hurry up? We’ve got to leave at 11 . 
 I’ve already told her that . 
 We use that to refer back to something that has already been spoken or written about: 
 If he gets that job in London, he’ll be able to visit us more often. 
}
===
{2 That : relative pronoun 
}{ We use that to introduce defining relative clauses. We can use that instead of who, whom or which to refer to people, animals and things. That is more informal than who or which : 
 She picked up the hairbrush that she had left on the bed. 
 He was the first director of the National Science Foundation, and he funded science research with an annual budget that grew to 500 million dollars.

{2 That’s + adjective 
}{ We use that’s + adjective (e.g. that’s lovely, that’s good, that’s great, that’s terrible, that’s awful) to respond to something that someone is telling us, to show that we are listening: 
 They got stuck in traffic on the way to the airport and missed the plane . 
 Oh, that’s awful . 
}
===
{2 That as an intensifier 
}{ We use not that + adjective to mean ‘not very’ or ‘not as … as you are saying’. We put spoken stress on that : 
 I thought the meal was delicious . 
 Mine wasn’t that nice . (My meal wasn’t as nice as you are saying. My meal wasn’t delicious.) 
 I wouldn’t be surprised if Emily became an actress . 
 I don’t think she’s that good .
